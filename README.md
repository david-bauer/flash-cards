# Flashcards App

Just a small webpage that lets users create and edit sets of two-sided flashcards. You would probably never use this over quizlet. It was good practice for html, css, and javascript.

## Current Functionality:

- Flippable cards
- Card creation
- Card editing mode
- Card deletion
- Card reorganization (drag them to new positions)
- Fancy animations for the above four
- Tooltips
- Pretty styling 
- Multiple sets on one page
- Options panel
- Import cards
- Export cards

## Future Functionality:

- Saving sets to somewhere
