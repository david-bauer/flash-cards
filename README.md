# Flashcards App

Just a small webpage that lets users create and edit sets of two-sided flashcards. You would probably never use this over quizlet. It was good practice for html, css, and javascript.

## Current Functionality:

- Flippable two-sided flash cards
- Card creation, modification and deletion
- Card reorganization (drag them to new positions)
- Flash card set creation, modification, and deletion
- Flash card sets persist across sessions with localStorage
- Import and export card sets
- Light and dark theme
- Simplistic animations
- Pretty color scheme

## Future Functionality:

- Saving sets to somewhere
